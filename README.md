# terminal_blog
Terminal blog from python course

This is a simple Terminal blog created during the course I took on Udemy.

The course can be found here: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-web-course-learn-by-building-8-apps/

It's also not a finalised project, it has a lot of comments of code that was generated during the course.
